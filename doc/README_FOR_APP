Checkpoint issue: truncation of number of questions per checkpoint

Ordering questions: needs to have a field for order and displayed in that order (aka acts_as_list or quick eval) 

Attendance tracking needs to be added

Employ Devise for authentication solution

Interface adjustments: some tasks/functions not obvious where to find them

Can add a user to organizations when created, but cannot change organizations thereafter

Kaminari for pagination 

Filter/search so we can find all of a certain type, etc.

Table of participants to glance with ability to drill down

Token autocomplete for key autocompleted fields (see railscast)

Events have field 'registration required' -- done only for those events

Mass attendance/registration

Everyone is part of FamilyTyes-At-Large so that it is easy to send out mass emails, announcements, etc.

Scale questions aren't really working properly

Administering a pre-test checkpoint
